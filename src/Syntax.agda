   A formalization of (raw) syntax with higher-order binders.

   We define a notion of syntax which allows for higher-order binders, variables and substitutions. Ordinary notions of
   variables are special cases:

   * order 1: ordinary variables and substitutions, for example those of λ-calculus
   * order 2: meta-variables and their instantiations
   * order 3: symbols (term formers) in dependent type theory, such as Π, Σ, W

   The syntax is parameterized by a type Class of syntactic classes. For example, in dependent type theory there might
   be two syntactic classes, ty and tm, corresponding to type and term expressions.

  {- Shapes are a kind of variable contexts. They assign to each variable its syntactic arity, which is a syntactic
     class and a binding shape. We model shapes as binary trees so that it is easy to concatenate two of them. A more
     traditional approach models shapes as lists, in which case one has to append lists. -}
