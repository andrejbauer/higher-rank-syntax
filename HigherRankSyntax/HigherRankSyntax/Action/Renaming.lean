# Renamings of shapes

A *renaming* `γ →ʳ δ` is an arity-respecting slot map: a function
`ShapeSlots γ → ShapeSlots δ` that sends each slot to a slot of the
same arity.  Renamings are the morphisms of the Shape category in
the relative-monad picture.

Arities form a **discrete** category — only identities — so no
separate notion of renaming on arities is needed.

## Notations

  - `γ →ʳ δ` is the type of renamings from γ to δ.
  - `𝟙ʳ` is the identity renaming.
  - `g ∘ʳ f` is the composition; the textual order reverses
    `Renaming.comp` so it reads "g after f", matching the
    mathematical `g ∘ f`.
  - `f ⇑ʳ β` extends a renaming `f` through a fresh binder of
    arity `β`.

The `ʳ` suffix is consistently on the right.
