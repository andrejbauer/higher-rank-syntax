# Renamings of shapes

A *renaming* `Γ →ʳ Δ` is an arity-respecting slot map: a function `Slot Γ → Slot Δ` that
sends each slot to a slot of the same arity.  Renamings are the morphisms of the Shape
category in the relative-monad picture.

Arities form a discrete category, so no separate notion of renaming on arities is needed.

## Notations

  - `Γ →ʳ Δ` is the type of renamings from `Γ` to `Δ`.
  - `𝟙ʳ` is the identity renaming.
  - `g ∘ʳ f` is the composition; the textual order reverses `Renaming.comp` so it reads
    "g after f", matching the mathematical `g ∘ f`.

The `ʳ` suffix is consistently on the right.
